# UC Irvine Statistics 131A - Michael C. Cranston Summer 2013

## Lecture 1
-  [VIDEO](https://youtu.be/GyN4FotAEt8)
- Sample Spaces @ 12:20
- Events @ 26:43
 - Example: Three Heads when Tossing a Coin 6 Times @  28:00
- Example: Straight Flush @ 32:00
- Example: k Successes Observed @ 38:00m
- Union/Intersection/A-B/ of Two Events: 41
- A complement @ 43
- Symmetric Difference of A and B @ 45:12
- Assigning Probability to Events @ 47:10
- Mutually Disjoint @ 49:45
- Empty Set is an event with Probability of zero - 51:54
- P(A Complement) = 1 - P(A) 53:58
- P(A) <= P(B), A subset B @ 56:30
 - Counting @  1:02:00
- P(A) = #A/#Omega Definition of Prob? @ 1:05:29 
- Derive above - All n disjoint events have same probability @ 1:08:45
- Multiplication Principle: m x n ways @ 1:14:25
- Example: Select 3 people without replacement, ordered 1:17:45
- Example: Select people with replacement, and ordering 1:20:25 
- Example: Committee of size 5 - consider over counting - Permutations @ 1:21:32
- Permutations - n! 1:24:00
- Example: Select r objects from set of n without replacement Derived n! / (n-r)!r! @ 1:27:00
- Find P(full house) - 1:31:35
- Find P(flush) - all cards of same suit @ 1:40:07

- Maximum Likelihood Estimator
- f(n+1)/f(n) > 1, when it stops being > 1, we have our estimator @ 1:50
- Multinomial Theorem Discussion @ 12:00
- Multi-nomial coefficient @ 16:18
- Multinomial Thereom Def @ 17:45
- Poker Example: 6 people, 5 cards each - 19:30
- # possible Bridge hands 22:20

- Misc Examples - 23:30
- conditional probability and independence 25:00
